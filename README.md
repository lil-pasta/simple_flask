# Basic Flask App
this is a basic flask app using the app factory pattern. I've included some comments for you but if you have any other questions let me know

## To run:
make sure you have all of the requirements installed. I recommend using a virtual environment for your projects.
install:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
will give you all of your dependencies

then simply
`flask run`

or, with debug mode:
`FLASK_DEBUG=true flask run`
